<img src="abc.jpg">

<p>The Badshahi Masjid is a Mughal era masjid in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab, Pakistan. The masjid is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks. The Badshahi Masjid was built by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction of the masjid lasting for two years until 1673. The masjid is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the largest masjid of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest masjid in Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the masjid was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights</p></div>

<h2>Lahore Fort:</h2>

<p>The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence. Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire</p>

<p>Kaghan Valley is an alpine valley in Mansehra District of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, attracting tourists from throughout Pakistan. The valley extends 155 kilometres across northern Pakistan, rising from an elevation of 2,134 feet to its highest point, the Babusar Pass, at 13,690 feet. Landslides triggered by the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake destroyed many passes leading into the valley, though roads have since been largely rebuilt.</p>

<h2>Mohenjo-daro:</h2>
<img src="aaaa.jpg" width="296px" height="202px">
<p>Mohenjo-daro is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.</p>
